14-Mar-17,Not enough exercises. Better have at least 10 programming exercises for each week. More difficult material = more exercises.
4-Mar-17,Needs to cover a bit more
20-Feb-17,Access to assignments and grades should be given.
9-Feb-17,"It may be the purpose of the course or the specialization, but I've been finding it too easy. I wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice."
18-Dec-16,too redundant
12-Nov-16,It is a good course for beginners in Python language.
10-Oct-16,"After also learning R from a non-Coursera MOOC, I find this Coursera course clunky and distractingly esoteric. Coursera occasionally crashes when attempting to parse or record the Python code that I've written, when that code runs fine on a regular IDE. This course in particular also includes lots of optional content that is either unnecessary (The Best Taco in the World video, for example) or for which it is unclear how to apply to Python (An interview with the inventor of JQuery, for example). Additionally, the instructor often assigns variable names that don't explain what the variable represents, which makes the videos a bit harder to follow than necessary. Despite all of this, I have learned a lot from this course."
7-Oct-16,"I really love the way Dr Chuck is teaching. It is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over 20 minutes long. After each lecture you do feel like you've become an expert in that topic.However, the course is very diluted.... Only 4-5 lectures over 7 weeks is too little content, especially if you are to pay the $79 required for certification. Each week contains a lot of videos that, although being interesting, are not directly relevant to the course. I finished the whole thing in 2 days ^^"
27-Sep-16,"to simple, not sure enough practice to be good at python"
18-Sep-16,"Explanations is pretty well, but it is not so difficulty. So it's good for beginners."
10-Sep-16,The assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end.
28-Jul-16,Way too expensive for its contents
23-Jun-16,Nice job ! However some of the important points have been skipped and focus has been limited at times.The best part of the course were the lab assignments.Hope quizzes were better in standard.
11-Jun-16,Too easy.
13-May-16,to easy
28-Apr-16,"simple and easy for Python beginners, the instructor also has a textbook that could be good instruction."
25-Apr-16,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos."
6-Apr-16,Somewhat dissapointed that only the built in Datastructures were discussed and done so with too much time.
24-Feb-16,Fair course. Severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles. Learned a lot from the course.
31-Jan-16,I think the course should include a little project.
18-Jan-16,Nice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level!
17-Jan-16,"Probably good for anyone coming from a non-programmer background.If you're a programmer, can learn everything in a few hours just by looking at any Python tutorial."
13-Jan-16,"The book really gave more details about the individual chapters. Hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videos.I recommend that specializations should follow this trend, so students who find it difficult to access Internet can use the book as a guide.More examples are needed to understand the concepts especially Tuples and DIctionary"
3-Jan-16,"Hello,The course has been designed in a way which can help a person who doesn't even know Programming. I do appreciate that!But, just one question that I have is, why the deadlines for the Assignments are designed in such a way that Week1 of Introduction Course, and the Advanced (Object Oriented Programming) have the same deadline?"
1-Jan-16,"well, it's the previous part of the Python for everyone. Why did Coursera split it to another course?"
1-Jan-16,Good to build python basic data the concept clear
27-Dec-15,good
15-Dec-15,"It's better than the first course of the series, but there is room for some more difficult assignments."
9-Dec-15,Decent course. Could be put together a lot nicer.
4-Dec-15,"Interesting, but the assignments were a bit dull. Learned a bit more about python."
23-Nov-15,It's a good course to learn about data structures for beginers.
7-Nov-15,"a little bit easy, I guess this course is for the beginners."
8-Oct-15,Very very very beginner level.
19-Sep-15,More content can be put in.
18-Sep-15,Not enough repetition in the way of homework. Expected a more rigorous course.
